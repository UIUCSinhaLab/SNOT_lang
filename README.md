# SNOT_lang
Simple Numerical Object Transcription (SNOT) is a language similar to JSON meant for numerical computing.

#### Bibliography

The SNOT grammar was adapted from the JSON grammer available here: https://gist.github.com/justjkk/436828/

I benefit from this tutorial: https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/lmcdowel/courses/si413/F10/labs/L04/calc1/ex1.html
(and parts of the code come from there, with heavy modifications.)

In future versions, I hope to benefit from this tutorial and make the grammer create better C++ code.
